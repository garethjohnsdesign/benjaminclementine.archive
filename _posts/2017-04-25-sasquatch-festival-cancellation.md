- You may have heard of the rescheduling of our performance at the Carnegie Hall.
  As it happens when it rains ... knee deep in mixing, mastering and fine tuning the
  album. We’re almost there but I’m afraid we’re having to cancel our Sasquatch performance
  next month to finish. The festival has a fantastic lineup with Bonobo, and we hope
  you will enjoy the festival without us on board. We hope to return to Sasquatch
  another year and sorry we won’t see you there this time.
