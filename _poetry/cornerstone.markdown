I’m alone in a box of stone  
When all is said and done  
As the wind blows to the East from the West  
Unto this bed my tears have their solemn rest  

I am lonely, alone in a box of stone  
They claimed to love me, but they’re all wrong  
For I have been lonely, alone in a box of my own  
And this is the place I will say I’ve only belonged  
It's my home  

It wasn’t easy getting used to this ; I used to scream  
It’s not true that it's only when a door is locked  
That nobody enters  
Cause mine had been opened till your own demise  
But none had come, well who am I?  
What have I done?  

I have been lonely, alone in a box of my own  
They claim to be near me but they’re all lying  
For I have been lonely, alone in a box of stone  
And this is place I now belong

Home home home home home

Friends I have met, lovers have slept and wept  
Promises to stay had never been kept  
This bare truth of which most won't share,  
I hope you share  

Cause I’ve been lonely, alone in a box of my own  
They claimed to love me  
And be near me, but they’re all lying  
I have been lonely, alone in a box of stone  
And this is the place I now belong  

It's my home.
