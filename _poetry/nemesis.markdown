If I held my breath on you,  
I would have died a thousand times  
And if chewing was to show you how much I cared  
I would probably be wearing dentures by now  

If I held my breath on you,  
I would have died a thousand times  
And if chewing was to show you how much I cared  
I would probably be wearing dentures by now  

Promises broken  
Nemesis our token  
So you turn around and march on out to your new home  
Wherever you've gone darling,  
Please don’t you ever forget to  

Treat others the way, you want to be treated  
Remember your days are fully numbered  

March on  

If you held your breath on me  
You would have died a million times  
And if chewing was to show me how much you cared  
You would have probably swallowed  
Your tongue by now  

All I’m trying to say darling,  
Is that you know very well  
That I left her for you  
Now I guess you are doing the same old,  
Same thing to me now  

These days Hennessy dries my veins  
As our genesis smiles back at me  
Now heresy might be your new fate, faith  
Whatever you‘ve chosen to believe in darling  
Don’t you ever forget to  

Treat others the way, you want to be treated  
Remember your days are fully numbered  

Treat others the way, you will want to be treated  
Remember your days are fully numbered  

Can’t say anything for you no more  
Nemesis is on your case, darling  
Next time,  
Treat others the way you want to be treated  
Otherwise you’ll get your punishment  
And life ain’t a bitch,  
Nemesis is,  
Is the mother of karma  

So long you run
