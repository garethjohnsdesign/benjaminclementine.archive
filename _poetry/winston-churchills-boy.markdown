Never in the field of human affection  
Had so much been given for so few attention  
Never in the field of human affection  
Had so much been given for so few attention  
Winston Boy  
Oh! There he is,  
Packing, quietly,  
Alone  
You could mistake a clock ticking  
For a cricket cricketing when around him.  

But I swear!  
Nobody knows what’s on this boy's mind,  
Nobody sees what he’s been picturing.  

“We all make a living by what we get,  
But we make life by what we give.  
In some special circumstances,  
This special circumstance,  
Winston Boy will have to earn a living  
Before he earns enough living to give”  

“Where is your family?  
Where are your loved ones?” someone uttered,  
Whilst he went on crossing the channel  
“Well they say no man can be a prophet  
In his own country and so I left and here I am  
Come on embrace me!  
I am your brother!”  
Now whilst he kept on talking,  
In his left pocket laid the prose of the magnificent  Orwell,  
His right hand embraced a battered  
Guitar borrowed,  
“Borrowed from me!”  
Come to think about it, I think a few years ago  
I heard him talk about how God blessed an eagle with 54 stars.  
And so maybe he’s gone, he’s gone wondering  
Around looking for his kind of star  
But even stars  
If we think about it, even beautiful stars  
They tend to shoot through the night  
And you will never find them again!  
Never and never and never again!  
And so don’t you judge Winston Boy,  
Don’t you ever judge Winston boy  

Cause one day this boy might be the man,  
Though clearly nobody knows when or how  
One day this boy will stand in front of a pulpit  
As the world gives him but a minute  
And there he will tell the world  
Where he’s been and how  
Underground to upper ground in the depths of  
I will surely survive  
He shares his story with a cup of tea streaming from his eyes  
One day this boy will be fine  
One day this boy will be fine  
So you better watch out now that day might be today!
