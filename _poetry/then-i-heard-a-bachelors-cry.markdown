Lately I’ve been searching, searching for answers  
I walk around the boulevards, looking for magicians  
With a cold feet, black coat full of arms  
Outstretched and a leading voice  
And I can’t help but shout at the top of my lungs  
Who is next in line to get hurt?  
Who is next in line to get speared?  

Bad mouth, bad habits  
Now leads icicles growing out me hair  
Our past I’d guaranteed you if you’d stay with me  
Your tomorrow will be endlessly free  

Don’t know what it was that had made you to come by  
Though I know God created me beautifully  
But don’t you know beauty will forever kill  
Who is next in line to get hurt?  
Who is next in line to get speared?  

I am sorry  
I can see our future  
It isn’t so bright  
There isn’t any light  

Who is next in line to get hurt?  
Who is next in line to get my spear?  

And so I wait  
I wait for my next prey  
I wait.  
Here.
