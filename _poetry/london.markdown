Now as I sit on the back of this grey caravan  
Tomorrow I will probably be  
Jumping Parisian metro barriers with  
A bottle in his hand  

Sparkling, sparkling water mixed with  
Peaches and rhum  
Honestly I don’t drink but if I did this sure will  
Be my favorite punch, he said  

Walk out the door with her  
And he could see everyone  
Dressed in black a class  
That seems too far too fetched  

She said, “Look at you, look at you, the game is over,  
The cup is full, stop praying for more exposure”  

“It is obvious that you are trying,  
Dubious stop or you will die here,  
You’re pretending but no one is buying”  

London is calling you, what are you waiting for,  
What you searching for?  
London is all in you, why are you denying the truth?  
“Well I might be boring you” he said  
“Although it's not clear as the morning due,  
When my preferred ways are not happening,  
I won't under estimate whom I am capable of becoming”  

History will be made to day is written  
Boldly on his face  
So clear you could hardly miss it,  
You could hardly miss it.  

For transcending the barriers of you,  
Yesterday was and is the dream  
On a road where Cleopatra comes and goes  
Like fishes caught in ponds then thrown back for fun  

She said, “look at you, look at you, just pick a fleet  
Your cup is full, what have you not yet achieved?”  

“It is obvious that you are trying, dubious stop or you will die here, your pretending but no one is buying"

London is calling you, what are you waiting for,
What you searching for?  
London is all in you, why are you in denial of the truth?  
“I might be boring you”, he said,  
“Although it's not clear as the morning due,  
When my preferred ways are not happening,  
I won't underestimate who I am capable of becoming”
