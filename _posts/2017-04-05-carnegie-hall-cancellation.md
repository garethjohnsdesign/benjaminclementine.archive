    After much deliberation and with deep regret we have to announce that we've decided to postpone our Carnegie Hall performance, scheduled for Wednesday 13th April. We would like to extend our sincere apologies to everyone who has bought a ticket and made plans to come and see us next week, and for any inconvenience and hardship this decision may cause. The new date will be confirmed as soon as possible, with all current tickets refunded.Â <br class="" /><br class="" />Unfortunately, and for reasons outside of our control, we have been delayed in the recording of the new album. These delays have in turn hindered our ability to prepare properly for the show, and most importantly have prevented us from fully rehearsing music from the new album which we were looking forward to playing for you so much. We would like this show to be special and focus on looking into the future rather than the past, and rushing now would not do justice to our musical cause.<br class="" /><br class="" />We are also very sorry that this announcement has been made so close to the original date of the show. For those who are wondering why this has happened this way, it has a lot to do with the logistics of moving the date to later in the year; the rather complex process of looking after existing ticket purchasers, finding a new date to play for you and co-ordinating the several different organisations involved with a show. <br class="" /><br class="" />For any hardship that can be helped with, we will assist with any enquiries. You can get in touch with the point of purchase if you have not been contacted already about a refund. Please accept our sincere apologies for any trouble this causes to your arrangements, and for those that are able to make it to the new date, we look forward to being able to play for you then.
