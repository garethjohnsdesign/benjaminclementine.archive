I think that I shall never see
A poem lovely as a black American man.

A black American man whose angry mouth is prest
Against the sweet earthâ€™s flowing breast;

A black American man that looks at God all day,
And lifts their bony arms to pray;

A black American man that may in summer wear
A nest of golden necklace around his neck;

Upon whose bosom some white men will slay;
Who intimately lives with pain.

Poems are made by fools like this lad,
But only God can make a black American man.
