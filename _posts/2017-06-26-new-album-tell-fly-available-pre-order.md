    Pre-order the new album, 'I Tell A Fly', and listen to 'God Save The Jungle' <a href="https://benjaminclementine.lnk.to/ITellAFlyAlbum" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">HERE</a>.
    
    'I Tell A Fly'. In little words - it's a story about two wandering flies finding fleet. I am neither a politician nor prophet but an artist who creates to only entertain is no better than a con. I hope this album fulfils its purpose as the continuation from 'At Least For Now'. Thank you for your kindness, warmth, patience and unparalleled support. Ars brevis, vita longa.
    
    I have carefully observed and come to the conclusion that my England is as much of a Jungle as Calais. I grew up in a Christian family but grew out of it due to some unforeseeable misfortunes. Yet, I still wonder if thereâ€™s a God out there to save us all. Or will we forever wander, till the road leads home.
