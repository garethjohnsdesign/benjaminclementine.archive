  - You may have heard of the rescheduling of our performance at the Carnegie Hall. As it happens when it rains ... knee deep in mixing, mastering and fine tuning the album. We’re almost there but I’m afraid we’re having to cancel our Sasquatch performance next month to finish. The festival has a fantastic lineup with Bonobo, and we hope you will enjoy the festival without us on board. We hope to return to Sasquatch another year and sorry we won’t see you there this time.
