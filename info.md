"I am an expressionist; I sing what I say, I say what I feel and I feel what I play by honesty and none other but honesty. Some will get bored of me, but I invite the patient listener to come forth, feel and most importantly engage with me without asking too many questions. Hopefully, by the end of listening they shall get answers not questionable, whether pleasing or not."
