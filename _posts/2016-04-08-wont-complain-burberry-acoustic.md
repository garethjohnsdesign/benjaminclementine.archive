- Benjamin Clementine was recently invited by Christopher Bailey to perform and record
  a version of ‘I Won't Complain’ for the new Burberry fragrance. This coincides with
  their partnership with the filmmaker and artist Steve McQueen on a film collaboration
  that features the original version of the song.
