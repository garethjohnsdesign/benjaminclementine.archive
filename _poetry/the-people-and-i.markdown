Woman, why are you looking at me?  
Woman, what are you looking for?  
Here the nation’s plea to hear  
How our down and fall came about  
And woman, don't close your eyes  
Let's be fair, we stand no more chance  
And I am done  
These times are precious times  
Only for the people and I  

Woman, the truth is here  
They ought to see it clear  
Excuse-me, I’m in a middle of a song  
Right after two years long  
In between different sheets  
Far beyond deceit,  
Dancing through the streets of infidelity  
And oh woman, don't close your eyes  
Let's be fair, we stand no more chance  
And I am done  
And these moments are precious moments  
Only for the people and I  

I sing, write, speak for the people and I  
Cause they are down  
And we are done  
And I am done  
So these moments and times are precious  
For the people and I
