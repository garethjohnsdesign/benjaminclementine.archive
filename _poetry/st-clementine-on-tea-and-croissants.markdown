Where is your son?  
Where did he go?  
Where is your son?  
Where did he go?  
Sweet Sugar Stranger  
Where did he go?  
I am asking you, where did he go?  
Where did you leave him?  
Do you know where he is now?  
Do you care?  
Go look for your son  
For even he who has no son looks for a different  
Kind of son to be their son  
Little Clementine is no tea and croissant
