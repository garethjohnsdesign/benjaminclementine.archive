BULLY:

No more nonsense!
And no sensitivities!
We will leave you alone!
We wont let you die!

KID:

O leave me or love me,
O leave me or help me.
Leave me alone!

[Tacet]

Enter Phantom through the window.

PHANTOM:

Billy the bully, Come on out of your hideout
Billy the Bully, its alright
Been forgiven, Come on out Zacchaeus;
Come down from your sick amour tree.
Where guns sing, roses are found dancing.
For me, the difference between love and hate,
Weighs the same difference between risotto and rice pudding.
And the difference between a dog and stranger,
Weighs the same difference between a child and their bully
Some say they know why you bully me, but I laugh O
For I know that you know that we will never know why
They keep the bullying, so Billy

Enter Fly all in flies, passes across.

FLY: (faintly behind and repeatedly):

Find the balance! Find the balance! Find the balance!

PHANTOM (continues):

It’s forgiven, Billy Bully Bully Billie
It’s all right.
O its fine.
And O if that’s a pram I see a-coming, then ah congratulations
Lets hope as the growing grows, we’ll be able to handle

FLY: (faintly interrupts and unknowingly): Find the balance!

Find the balance! Find the balance! Find the balance!

PHANTOM (to Kid): Billy the Bully! (They fall into each other’s arms.)

Once a serious case, twice a forgiven case
The Wanderings a-never ending.
The Wanderings a-never ceasing.

Exit Not.
