Talk to me friend, talk to me, talk to me  
I am listening to your advice  
Slowly, slowly, please, slowly,  
We have a lot of time  
Sometimes I would wish that you were I  
To see clearly, not just visualize  
Many people said  
Oh I’m lost, I’m a bastard, Oh I’m lost  
Those same people pray,  
For the best, for their own brothers,  
So why would I quiver but quiver a little,  
Then burst in laughter  

Read all the books and you will find  
Nothing new has been hidden underneath the sun  
Integrity is sometimes hard to climb  
But if I look up, not down, and maybe who knows  
I might go a bit further up there  
Many people will say  
Oh you’re lost, you are a bastard, you’re lost  
Those same people pray  
For the best, for their own sisters  
And so I will only quiver a little,  
Then burst in laughter  

Life is as cold not literally as in Greenland  
Where snowfall is the norm  
As opposed to the ray of sunlight  
But, like the boy who woke up one night  
To see his poor mother on the floor  
And he screamed, “Mother, wake up!”  
So why would you waste a lot of you energy  
On what people might say  
Just quiver a little,  
Then burst in laughter  
Quiver a little then get back to your stride
