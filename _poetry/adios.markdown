Adios  
Adios  
Adios to your afternoon  
Tonight I will be forever  
Following the colosseum moon  
Into a certain room  

Adios  
Adios  
I am sorry for quickly jumping into the train  
I waited but no one came  
You’re just a little bit too late  

The decision is mine  
The decision is mine  
So let the lesson be mine  
Let the lesson be mine  
The decision is mine  
The decision is mine  
Cause the vision is mine  
The vision is mine  

Adios  
Yes, goodbye, adios  
Adios to the little child in me  
Who kept on blaming everyone else  
Instead facing his own defeat in Edmonton  
After all, why should I regret  
If it wasn’t for the mistakes we made yesterday?  
Where would we be by now?  

The decision is mine  
The decision is mine  
So let the lesson be mine  
Let the lesson be mine  
The decision was hard  
The decision was hard  
Cause the vision is mine  
The vision is mine  

Lest the trees cease breathing  
Lest all the bees cease breeding  
And all the salts in the dead sea ferment to honey  

Until then, I will be forever  
Chasing it all till the very end  

The decision is mine  
So let the lesson be mine  
Cause the vision is mine  
The decision is mine  
So let the lesson be mine  
Cause the vision is mine
