And no sensitivities!
We will leave you alone!
We wont let you die!</p>

O leave me or help me.
Leave me alone!</p>

<p>Billy the bully, Come on out of your hideout
Billy the Bully, its alright
Been forgiven, Come on out Zacchaeus;
Come down from your sick amour tree.
Where guns sing, roses are found dancing.
For me, the difference between love and hate,
Weighs the same difference between risotto and rice pudding.
And the difference between a dog and stranger,
Weighs the same difference between a child and their bully
Some say they know why you bully me, but I laugh O
For I know that you know that we will never know why
They keep the bullying, so Billy</p>
<p>Enter Fly all in flies, passes across.</p>
<p>FLY: (faintly behind and repeatedly):</p>
<p>Find the balance! Find the balance! Find the balance!</p>
<p>PHANTOM (continues):</p>
<p>It’s forgiven, Billy Bully Bully Billie
It’s all right.
O its fine.
And O if that’s a pram I see a-coming, then ah congratulations
Lets hope as the growing grows, we’ll be able to handle</p>
<p>FLY: (faintly interrupts and unknowingly): Find the balance!</p>
<p>Find the balance! Find the balance! Find the balance!</p>
<p>PHANTOM (to Kid): Billy the Bully! (They fall into each other’s arms.)</p>
<p>Once a serious case, twice a forgiven case
The Wanderings a-never ending.
The Wanderings a-never ceasing.</p>
<p>Exit Not.</p>

Never in the field of human affection<br />
Had so much been given for so few attention<br />
Winston Boy<br />
Oh! There he is,<br />
Packing, quietly,<br />
Alone<br />
You could mistake a clock ticking<br />
For a cricket cricketing when around him.</p>
<p>But I swear!<br />
Nobody knows what’s on this boy’s mind,<br />
Nobody sees what he’s been picturing.</p>
<p>“We all make a living by what we get,<br />
But we make life by what we give.<br />
In some special circumstances,<br />
This special circumstance,<br />
Winston Boy will have to earn a living<br />
Before he earns enough living to give”</p>
<p>“Where is your family?<br />
Where are your loved ones?” someone uttered,<br />
Whilst he went on crossing the channel<br />
“Well they say no man can be a prophet<br />
In his own country and so I left and here I am<br />
Come on embrace me!<br />
I am your brother!”<br />
Now whilst he kept on talking,<br />
In his left pocket laid the prose of the magnificent  Orwell,<br />
His right hand embraced a battered<br />
Guitar borrowed,<br />
“Borrowed from me!”<br />
Come to think about it, I think a few years ago<br />
I heard him talk about how God blessed an eagle with 54 stars.<br />
And so maybe he’s gone, he’s gone wondering<br />
Around looking for his kind of star<br />
But even stars<br />
If we think about it, even beautiful stars<br />
They tend to shoot through the night<br />
And you will never find them again!<br />
Never and never and never again!<br />
And so don’t you judge Winston Boy,<br />
Don’t you ever judge Winston boy</p>
<p>Cause one day this boy might be the man,<br />
Though clearly nobody knows when or how<br />
One day this boy will stand in front of a pulpit<br />
As the world gives him but a minute<br />
And there he will tell the world<br />
Where he’s been and how<br />
Underground to upper ground in the depths of<br />
I will surely survive<br />
He shares his story with a cup of tea streaming from his eyes<br />
One day this boy will be fine<br />
One day this boy will be fine<br />
So you better watch out now that day might be today!</p>

I walk around the boulevards, looking for magicians<br />
With a cold feet, black coat full of arms<br />
Outstretched and a leading voice<br />
And I can’t help but shout at the top of my lungs<br />
Who is next in line to get hurt?<br />
Who is next in line to get speared?</p>
<p>Bad mouth, bad habits<br />
Now leads icicles growing out me hair<br />
Our past I’d guaranteed you if you’d stay with me<br />
Your tomorrow will be endlessly free</p>
<p>Don’t know what it was that had made you to come by<br />
Though I know God created me beautifully<br />
But don’t you know beauty will forever kill<br />
Who is next in line to get hurt?<br />
Who is next in line to get speared?</p>
<p>I am sorry<br />
I can see our future<br />
It isn’t so bright<br />
There isn’t any light</p>

Who is next in line to get my spear?</p>

I wait for my next prey<br />
I wait.<br />

I am listening to your advice<br />
Slowly, slowly, please, slowly,<br />
We have a lot of time<br />
Sometimes I would wish that you were I<br />
To see clearly, not just visualize<br />
Many people said<br />
Oh I’m lost, I’m a bastard, Oh I’m lost<br />
Those same people pray,<br />
For the best, for their own brothers,<br />
So why would I quiver but quiver a little,<br />
Then burst in laughter</p>
<p>Read all the books and you will find<br />
Nothing new has been hidden underneath the sun<br />
Integrity is sometimes hard to climb<br />
But if I look up, not down, and maybe who knows<br />
I might go a bit further up there<br />
Many people will say<br />
Oh you’re lost, you are a bastard, you’re lost<br />
Those same people pray<br />
For the best, for their own sisters<br />
And so I will only quiver a little,<br />
Then burst in laughter</p>
<p>Life is as cold not literally as in Greenland<br />
Where snowfall is the norm<br />
As opposed to the ray of sunlight<br />
But, like the boy who woke up one night<br />
To see his poor mother on the floor<br />
And he screamed, “Mother, wake up!”<br />
So why would you waste a lot of you energy<br />
On what people might say<br />
Just quiver a little,<br />
Then burst in laughter<br />
Quiver a little then get back to your stride</p>

Boldly on his face<br />
So clear you could hardly miss it,<br />

Yesterday was and is the dream<br />
On a road where Cleopatra comes and goes<br />
Like fishes caught in ponds then thrown back for fun</p>

Your cup is full, what have you not yet achieved?”</p>

      <p>I remember walking down the A406<br />
Holding bags of mother sent cornflakes<br />
Guessing somebody might have noticed<br />
A little boy big head small ears<br />
Whilst making a ballad through a Sunday mist<br />
Sure we’ve all been there, done it<br />
Prepare a little time to reminisce<br />
On all that eventually falls into nothingness</p>
<p>Oh, all will be gone<br />
After all<br />
Before we all get to the knowing<br />
All will be gone</p>
<p>I went back to where life seemed promising at first<br />
Gambling on memory’s lane<br />
I tried a trip through all the pavements and fields<br />
But I lost cause all had changed<br />
Like the road I used to cross to school<br />
Is now full of prostitutes<br />
No wonder why the priest is dead<br />
No wonder why the priest is dead<br />
Oh brother, when did you get married?<br />
Neighbours, where did you vanish to?<br />
If it was to a wonderland,<br />
Well, it’s not known to my kind, mankind</p>
<p>All will be gone<br />
After all<br />
Before we all get to the knowing<br />
All will be gone</p>
<p>And what about relationship?<br />
What is it about relationships that we just don’t get?<br />
Here we are always thinking we’ve learnt<br />
Only to get smacked and realize we are<br />
But mere students of life<br />
And feels like<br />
We’ve been fighting a lost battle<br />
To have always realize at the end of it all<br />
It feels like<br />
We’ve been brought to a royal banquet,<br />
Just to be served a brew and a wretched floor<br />
But I say<br />
It doesn’t matter anymore,<br />
It doesn’t matter<br />
All because I’m here now<br />
I can’t go back, it’s too late<br />
And so I will get it all going,<br />
Whilst it all gets lost and gone.</p>

      <p>I’m alone in a box of stone<br />
When all is said and done<br />
As the wind blows to the East from the West<br />
Unto this bed my tears have their solemn rest</p>
<p>I am lonely, alone in a box of stone<br />
They claimed to love me, but they’re all wrong<br />
For I have been lonely, alone in a box of my own<br />
And this is the place I will say I’ve only belonged<br />
It’s my home</p>
<p>It wasn’t easy getting used to this ; I used to scream<br />
It’s not true that it’s only when a door is locked<br />
That nobody enters<br />
Cause mine had been opened till your own demise<br />
But none had come, well who am I?<br />
What have I done?</p>
<p>I have been lonely, alone in a box of my own<br />
They claim to be near me but they’re all lying<br />
For I have been lonely, alone in a box of stone<br />
And this is place I now belong</p>
<p>Home home home home home</p>
<p>Friends I have met, lovers have slept and wept<br />
Promises to stay had never been kept<br />
This bare truth of which most won’t share,<br />
I hope you share</p>
<p>Cause I’ve been lonely, alone in a box of my own<br />
They claimed to love me<br />
And be near me, but they’re all lying<br />
I have been lonely, alone in a box of stone<br />
And this is the place I now belong</p>
<p>It’s my home.</p>

      <p>I swear, you’ve seen me<br />
You’ve seen me here before<br />
And so don’t tell it, don’t tell it otherwise</p>
<p>This voice, this particular voice<br />
Yes, you’ve heard it before, before<br />
And so don’t you dare tell it,<br />
Don’t you dare tell it otherwise</p>
<p>No wonder, why the road seems so long<br />
Cause I had done it all before<br />
And I won<br />
You felt this feeling, tell me don’t be ashamed<br />
You felt it before, before<br />
And so don’t tell me<br />
Don’t tell me otherwise</p>
<p>I almost forgot, foolish me, I almost forgot<br />
Where I am from we see the rain<br />
Before the rain even starts to rain</p>
<p>No wonder why you’ve been buggering me<br />
This walk is a previous journey</p>
<p>And I won<br />
Before I was born there was a storm<br />
Before that storm there was fire<br />
Burning everywhere,<br />
And everything became nothing again<br />
And then out of nothing<br />
Out of absolutely nothing, I, Benjamin, I was born<br />
So that when I become someone one day<br />
I will always remember that I came from nothing</p>
<p>No wonder, why you’ve been buggering me<br />
This walk, it’s a previous journey</p>
<p>And no wonder why the road seems so long<br />
Cause I had done it all before</p>
<p>And I won</p>
<p>I’m sending my condolence<br />
I’m sending my condolence to fear<br />
I’m sending my condolence<br />
I’m sending my condolence to insecurities<br />
You should know by now<br />
You should know by now<br />
That I just don’t care<br />
For what you might say<br />
Might bring someone downhill<br />
I’m sending my condolence<br />
To fear<br />
I’m sending my condolence<br />
To insecurities</p>

Adios to your afternoon<br />
Tonight I will be forever<br />
Following the colosseum moon<br />
Into a certain room</p>
<p>Adios<br />
Adios<br />
I am sorry for quickly jumping into the train<br />
I waited but no one came<br />
You’re just a little bit too late</p>
<p>The decision is mine<br />
The decision is mine<br />
So let the lesson be mine<br />
Let the lesson be mine<br />
The decision is mine<br />
The decision is mine<br />
Cause the vision is mine<br />
The vision is mine</p>
<p>Adios<br />
Yes, goodbye, adios<br />
Adios to the little child in me<br />
Who kept on blaming everyone else<br />
Instead facing his own defeat in Edmonton<br />
After all, why should I regret<br />
If it wasn’t for the mistakes we made yesterday?<br />
Where would we be by now?</p>
<p>The decision is mine<br />
The decision is mine<br />
So let the lesson be mine<br />
Let the lesson be mine<br />
The decision was hard<br />
The decision was hard<br />
Cause the vision is mine<br />
The vision is mine</p>
<p>Lest the trees cease breathing<br />
Lest all the bees cease breeding<br />
And all the salts in the dead sea ferment to honey</p>
<p>Until then, I will be forever<br />
Chasing it all till the very end</p>
<p>The decision is mine<br />
So let the lesson be mine<br />
Cause the vision is mine<br />
The decision is mine<br />
So let the lesson be mine<br />
Cause the vision is mine</p>
